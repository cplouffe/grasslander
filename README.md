todo list:

1		code documentation
			-will do as I go and revise before handing off
		handle beta testing changes as needed
			-limited input/changes to major bugs and/or deemed important changes that cause minor delay in initial release.
		relay codebase structure and features to OCS and code curator
			- yet to do, end of initial beta/as needed next week
		nav bar structure/layout
			- done? rearranged "setup" menu to be sole step transition aside from "proceed" button that is prompted only after creating a new feature between each step sequentially. May want to add an additional option of "no changes". Also may want to re-implement a double-click, "change attribute" modal for each setup step to change attributes instead of requiring the deletion/redelinitation of features at each step.

	Others:
		>UI/Procedural workflow comments/change suggestions

		>Create content in html for nav bar/forms/images/icons

		> Create and add aggregating baselayer data (e.g., ebird/NHIC data) with user contributions. Or, grid "bin-based" layer for other farmer data.

		>Creating and adding user "feedback" charts and info graphics --- i.e., the d3 charts Jen worked on and birdObservation infographics Cam has suggested. Right now limited to "Plight of the BoboLink" submenu of nav-bar, but can add to sidebar later if desired through tabs.

		>adding addition form inputs and feature service fields asking for more information than the information regarding "field descriptions" obtained June 6th, 2016.

		> Implementing any further changes in plateform capabilities and features (e.g., user registration/contact and landing page) following approval of he beta-testing phase (ending June 18th 2016) -- obviously excluding minor codebase clarification/assistance and on the event of initial codebase needs further debugging following plateform's initial deployment.

		> user registration and authentication

		>database optimization and maintenance, as well as any database triggers or templates that need created or modified beyond beta-testing phase. Within reason.

		>arcserver and feature service maintenance/adminstration.


		#New stuff to add
			- fix sidebar thing!
